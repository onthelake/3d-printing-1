This is a slightly modified version of the [Money Spinner](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1937473) by GeoffB. I had a lot of 20 Euro cent coins lying around, and wanted to use those.

Instead of selecting from a short list of coins, now you have to put in the size of your favorite coin directly. Look it up at Wikipedia, do a web search, or use a caliper. I also added the bearing caps from Arondite’s [Fidget Toy Comfort Spinner](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1816684)

Unfortunately, my printer is still in the mail, so i have not tested the design.

Included are two variants of the spinner, one with three spokes for three 20 Euro cent coins. For the other one i wanted it BIG. That can’t be made with the customizer, as the coin stacks are higher than the bearing. For that you should use 28 20 Euro cent coins, in seven spokes à four coins.
