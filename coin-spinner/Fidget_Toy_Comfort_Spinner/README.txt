# Summary

BANDWAGON!!!

I printed a few of these from another's design, and hated it. It was large and had sharp edges. So to practice my modelling skills I hit cad and modeled this up. They work great and have rounded edges for aesthetics and comfort.

The center caps have a concave cap to make it easier and more natural to hold it at it's center. I printed these upside down with support. The require cleanup but ultimately feel much better on the external face.

EDIT:
-Uses standard 608zz skateboard bearings
