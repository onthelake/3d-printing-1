## Customizable funnel with stand

A funnel where the main parameters can be changed. You either get a special stand with it or not.

When the stand is selected, about half of a stand is printed connected to the funnel, the other half to the holder plate. Just stick the funnel’s part onto the stand, and you can place your container under the funnel.

I use it to fill paper tea filters with tea. For those you need a stand like this.



### Customizer

I wanted a funnel with a rather low throat ratio, if that is the
term. For the tea i wanted to use it with, the necks of supermarket
funnels were too tight. So this starts with 3 cm, but change them to
taste.


The wall thickness should be a multiple of your nozzle diameter, but then again, large parts are sloped, which throws of this value.

### Print Settings

* I used a 300 µm layer height, because this thing is more about utility than aesthetics, but use whatever you like
* No supports
* No raft or brim


### Food safety concerns

* When you want to funnel foodstuffs, you should probably PLA, food grade PLA when you are concerned.
* You should probably clean your nozzle once, to get rid of mineral oil and other residues.
* When you use an oiler, use a suitable oil. Maybe a vegetable oil or something like balistol oil.
* The funnelled material comes into contact with the printed parts for only a short time, so it should not be effected by the plastic too much. Especially when you use dry stuff.

These two articles shed some more light on the issue:
* [10 things you need to know about 3D printing & food safety](https://pinshape.com/blog/3d-printing-food-safe/)
* [Food Safe Video](https://joes3dworkbench.blogspot.de/2015/07/food-safe-video.html)

In the end, it is up to you. I can take no responsibility.


### Github

This part is also available at
[github](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/tea-portioner). When
the version here is ever updated, look at the repo there for older
versions.
