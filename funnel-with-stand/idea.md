Parametric funnel where you set top diameter, neck diameter, neck length.
It gets one hexagonal lugs to fit on the stand.


The stand is the hexagonal post, open at top, with low infill, a hexagonal base with a thin plate with patter/image and a rim with the cross section of half a hexagon.
Change the height.


For me, do the funnel with d_neck = 3 cm – 4 cm, top 8 cm.

Height

The stand with a size that you can put in a tea filter, so that it stays there.

You than pour tea in at the top, it falls into the tea filter, you take it out, and you’re done.


The funnel gets one part of the stand post, up to the top/bottom.

The stand post has a hexagonal cross section, sized like a pencil.
The connection of one part to the next is a bigger hexagonal tube, with ½ the width as wall thickness. Height of that bit: 3 cm

Fill bits between post and funnel, and between post and base with 0.8 mm (2 × nozzel size) honeycomb mesh. Just the borders, lots of holes, edge length 4 mm.
