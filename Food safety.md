## Food and 3D printing

Some of my designs will come into contact with food.

These two articles shed some light on the issue:
* [10 things you need to know about 3D printing & food safety](https://pinshape.com/blog/3d-printing-food-safe/)
* [Food Safe Video](https://joes3dworkbench.blogspot.de/2015/07/food-safe-video.html)

In general, it’s a good idea to analyze risks and benefits.

One thing those two articles don’t mention is mineral oil. When you use a filament oiler, you should use vegatble oil rather than mineral oil, and change it regularly. Cleaning your extruder nozzle once seems to be a good idea, too, to get rid of oil and other production residues.

That said, with those precautions, for the tea portioner and funnel, i think when you make them out of PLA there shouldn’t be any problems. The tea leaves are in contact with the material for only a short time, they are dry and shouldn’t leach out too much from the PLA, and you pour *boiling* water over the tea leaves, which should kill most of the bacteria.

For the teapot lid, which gets too hot for PLA, you may think about sealing it with a food safe varnish.

When all is said and done, you are responsible for your own safety.
