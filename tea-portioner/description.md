## Customizable tea (sugar, coffee &c.) portioner

Quickly measure the right amount of tea leaves for one pot, or other granular materials where you need the same amount every day.

The STL files are for 44 cm³ (44 ml) and 55 cm³ (55 ml), the right amount of roibos tea for my two teapots, 1 dm³ (1 l) and 1.25 dm³ (1.25 l). For the measuring cup, there are versions, with and without feet.


### Customizer


* Main parameter is the volume. When you know the mass to use, you need the density. For roibos, the 44 cm³ and 55 cm³ is for 12 g and 15g, that is 270 kg/m³ or 0.27 g/cm³
* When you have a mass, look up the density in the [FAO list](http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap815e/ap815e.pdf), elsewhere, or measure yourself.
* Set the wall thickness to a multiple of your nozzle size
* Choose feet or no feet. With the feet it’s a bit harder to knock over, but aesthetics may suggest to leave them off.
* The “American customary units” *is* a bit of a joke, or my pet peeve. GIYF when you want to know how many cm³ are in 7/13 cups, or whatever in is your recipe says.

### Print Settings

* Use PLA, food grade PLA when you are concerned. See below
* I used a 300 µm layer height, because this thing is more about utility than aesthetics.
* No supports
* Use a brim when you are concerned the chute will fall over during printing


### How to use

* Slide the funnel into the measuring cup
* Pour in the tea leaves until the cup is a bit over full
* Slide out the funnel, striking the measuring cup and pouring the extra tea back in its tin
* The measure now contains the right amount of tea. Pour it into the filter or teapot.


### Safety concerns

* PLA seems to be better suited for food use than ABS, so you should use that
* You should probably clean your nozzle once, to get rid of mineral oil and other residues.
* When you use an oiler, use a suitable oil. Maybe a vegetable oil or something like balistol oil.
* The food comes into contact with the printed parts for only a short time, and it is usually dry, so it should hardly be effected at all.

These two articles shed some more light on the issue:
* [10 things you need to know about 3D printing & food safety](https://pinshape.com/blog/3d-printing-food-safe/)
* [Food Safe Video](https://joes3dworkbench.blogspot.de/2015/07/food-safe-video.html)

In the end, it is up to you. I can take no responsibility.
