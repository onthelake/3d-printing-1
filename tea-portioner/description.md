## Customizable tea (sugar, coffee &c.) portioner

Quickly measure the right amount of tea leaves for one pot, or other granular materials where you need the same amount every day.

The STL files are for 44 cm³ (44 ml) and 55 cm³ (55 ml), the right amount of roibos tea for my two teapots, 1 dm³ (1 l) and 1.25 dm³ (1.25 l). They are smoother than what you get out of the customizer. If you want this smoothness, download the SCAD file, open it and reduce the `$fa` value according to the comment.


If you like to strike off the funnel to the left, you should mirror the measuring cup before you print it



### Customizer


* Main parameter is the volume. When you know the mass to use, you need the density. For roibos, the 44 cm³ and 55 cm³ is for 12 g and 15g, that is 270 kg/m³ or 0.27 g/cm³
* When you have a mass, look up the density in the [FAO list](http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap815e/ap815e.pdf), elsewhere, or measure yourself.
* This is no precise measuring device. Expect large tolerances.
* The “American customary units” *is* a bit of a joke, or my pet peeve. GIYF when you want to know how many cm³ are in 7/13 cups, or whatever it is your recipe says.

### Print Settings

* Supports: no
* Brim: yes Measuring cup only. The chute may fall over without.
* Make sure the chute is to the left or right on Prusa style printers, or the y axis acceleration would put extra force on it.


### How to use

* Place the funnel on the measuring cup. There *is* a right way, with the wider brim of the funnel on the flat surface of the cup, but with the funnel in another direction it should work well, too.
* Pour in the tea leaves until the cup is a bit over full
* Slide off the funnel, striking the measuring cup and pouring the extra tea back in its tin over the chute
* The measure now contains the right amount of tea. Pour it into the filter or teapot. I use my funnel and stand for this

### Safety concerns

* PLA seems to be better suited for food use than ABS, so you should use that
* You should probably clean your nozzle once, to get rid of mineral oil and other residues.
* When you use an oiler, use a suitable oil. Maybe a vegetable oil or something like Ballistol oil.
* The food comes into contact with the printed parts for only a short time, and it is usually dry, so it should hardly be effected at all.

These two articles shed some more light on the issue:
* [10 things you need to know about 3D printing & food safety](https://pinshape.com/blog/3d-printing-food-safe/)
* [Food Safe Video](https://joes3dworkbench.blogspot.de/2015/07/food-safe-video.html)

In the end, it is up to you. I can take no responsibility.
