I want a container at the bottom, with the right volume for one pot of roibos tea. That is about 53 ml.

Add a stand so i won’t knock that thing over with every careless movement.

As a second part, a hopper on top so i can just pour the tea in.

I then want to slide the hopper to the side, and with that movement strike the measuer , so that i have the exact ammount. The stirking instrument for this was traditionally called “strickle”, so the top part can be called hoppre/strickle.

For the tea falling back into the storage tin, there has to be some sort of spillway on one side.

Abandoning some earlier ideas, there will be no second hopper/spillway to pour out the measured tea.

Also, when striking the tea, the hopper is pulled out all the way, and the tea then poured from only the bottom part into the tea filter, or the hopper for that.
