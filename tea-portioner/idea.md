I want a container at the bottom, with the right volume for one pot of roibos tea. That is about 53 ml.

Add a stand so i won’t knock that thing over with every careless movement.

As a second part, a hopper on top so i can just pour the tea in.

I then want to slide the hopper to the side, and with that movement strike the measuer (gestrichenes Maß), so that i have the exact ammount.

For that, i need some sort of spillway on one side, where the tea falls back into the storage tin.

Then i need a spillway/hopper where i pour the tea leaves into the filter. Probably on the other side to the first spillway.

There will probably be a groove on the sides and the top of the thing where the top bit is sliding along.
