Two therometer stands for my Hg thermometer

One vertical:
Two rings:
* Bottom one so the bulb slides through it and rests below it, in the air, and the main tube rests on it. This one takes most of the waight.
* Top one, slightly larger, above the scale

The stand may have to be done in two bits, for length, or three, plate, lower part of stand, and upper part.

Another one horizontal:
* Base plate with two square holes
* Two stands with ring clamps on top
