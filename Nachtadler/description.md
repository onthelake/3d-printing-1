There is this really nice mini flash light called the Nachteule (night owl) that you clip to your spectacles. Great for reading in bed, or just to get things out of the basement without turning on the overhead lights. There’s only one problem: what to do when you don’t need spectacles? So here is an ear clip with a small tray to clip your Nachteule to when you have hawk eyed (have Adleraugen in German).


This is, to a degree, sized for *my* ear. Especially the tragus gap. I included the FreeCAD file. Change the sizes in the drawings to make it fit.

print setup
I used PETG, but i think PLA should work almost as well. The standard printer settings don’t matter much, but you need reasonably good bed adhesion. If this fails more then once you may want to use a brim.
More importantly: When you don’t have a filament cooling fan, you should not print this alone. Put a second thing that is at least 15.4 mm high on the platter along with it to give it time to cool. Either print it along with that other thing you want, or just use a second Nachtadler. Mirror it and you have one for either ear.
