Yet another shopping cart token. With a message. Make that as political as you want.

I use these as test objects, print out a bunch of them from time to time, and treat them as expendable. Then, when i go shopping, i use one to free a shopping cart, and leave it in when i’m done. The next customer then gets to read my message, when ey brings back eir free cart. Just remember to bring back the cart to the parking position.


I’ve added the OpenSCAD source file so you can tinker with it. You can change the size (if your’re not in Euroland) and the message. You should also change the `font_name` for a font you like and have.

Currently, there is just one version:

* One with the text sunk, for singel extruder machines

But i want to add two more:

* One in two STLs. Combine them in the slicer to get standard dual extrusion
* Another one one STL with the text hanging in the air. Use this for ditto printing almost twice as many tokens in one go when you know how to do this. (One row should end up with sunk text that works reasonably well)
