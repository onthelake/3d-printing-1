## 3d printing

This is collection of OpenSCAD files, scripts and other files for 3d printing designs i came up with or found and remixed.

### Universal teapot lid

A lid for teapots with lots of parameters to adapt to basically all teapots and other containers.

Early design phase.

### Tea portioner and hopper

An idea of a gadget to portion my roibos tea leaves and pour it into
the filter holder.

Just an idea at the moment.

### Thingiverse

Finished designs, these and others, will be uploaded to my [thingiveres account](https://www.thingiverse.com/ospalh/about).
